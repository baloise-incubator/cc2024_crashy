## Demo
- case 1: accident with an animal
- case 2: car radio theft
- case 3: scratched car surface

## Conclusions:
- given JSON structure can reliably be extracted
- gpt4o object detection yields acceptable results
- gpt4o visual model is affordable (<0.2 cents/pic)
- speech to text works if audio quality is good
- swiss german words are not recognized
- overall service latency is really good
- gpt4o audio preview is atm. no better than currently used whisper
